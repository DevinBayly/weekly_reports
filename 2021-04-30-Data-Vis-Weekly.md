# Data & Visualization Weekly Projects Report 2021_04_30

## Active Projects 


### Active Development 

* Advice For Thesis Defense Visualizations, Sabrina Nardin 
	 * Answered follow up questions about her new stream graph over email
* Biosphere 2 Biosystems Visualization Collaboration 
	 * Didn't connect with Omani last week because of a time conflict on her end with building maintenance
	 * Started working on a Proof of Concept for helping to convert models into point clouds
	 * Wrote a js triangle sampling program which will be used when loading pixels from an image that is used as a mesh face texture. https://trianglesampler.baylyd.repl.co/
	 * Had a big meeting with Ash, Victoria, and  Aaron and it sounds like I'll be working with Tech Core students this summer on the Biosphere2 collab
* Bryan Carter Photogrammetry 
	 * Meeting Tayvien who works with Bryan on Thursday this week
	 * Will spend some time getting him started with apporto and metashape to test things out
* Data Visualization Roadshow With Jeff Oliver 
* Independent Study Abby Collier 
	 * Abby won the SBS senior award !!
	 * Met and discussed how to use actively moving particles positions for sampling other textures
	 * This is the foundation of reactive particle systems, so we now can use video input of a person to manipulate our particle system!
	 * Will work with Blake to submit grade before the end of the semester
* Jason Hortin Holographic Dance Graduate Project 
	 * Wrote another email to Jason and mentioned he should get his project into the running for projects listed in the tech core summer Internship
	 * He also reached out to Dr. Bryan Carter recently to see what the options were for doing volumetric capture footage recording
	 * Sounds like more will happen in the fall because he's going back to Chicago for the summer
* Judging The Data Visualization Challenge 
	 * Completed this, my favorite entries also were the ones that won so at least I was judging along the lines of the others
* Migrant Forensic Empathy Project: A Digital Borderlands Grant Initiative 
	 * Time to really push on this project
	 * discovered that the "shader:flat" method can help eliminate artifacts introduced from a renderer that's struggling with shadows on a large mesh
	 * rewrote the populate and query side of the quad-tree in non recursive algorithms, and dealt with bug that was running my machine out of memory in the development of this
	 * New ideas about how to integrate the shrine into the landscape in a modular fashion
	 * Will probably make a shallow quadtree for querying the user position every 5 seconds to see if we need to render more or less crosses in the environment
* Oyster Vibrio Literature Review 
	 * Emily had her defense last week, will now reach out to see if she is happy with the project and wants to call it done
* Remote Visualization Infrastructure Development 
	 * Met with Chris and discussed remote visualization options
	 * Sounds like we should look into other tools that support rendering vulkan windows that aren't just NoMachine, still need to get to the bottom of that conversation with Chris
	 * Discussed Omniverse usage
	 * Tested Vulkan on each HPC and each have the same Invalid Driver message
	 * Created a vulkan issue on their tracker https://vulkan.lunarg.com/issue/view/608706d05df112e5e0a11a5a
* Resbaz Organizer And Workshop Provider 
	 * Met Chinmay one more time
	 * Heard back from Kelsey about what the listing should be for the videos (public unless the instructor says otherwise), I think we need to make sure that's spelled out for folks attending workshops
	 * Got our Observable workshop listed in the webpage
* Stellarscape Astronomy Multimedia Dance Performance 
	 * Wrote code to generate multisegment lines, but got stuck with how to apply this with multi line data also
	 * Got curious about the scanline fill algorithms used to color the interior of geometries that we express with lines
	 * Met with Gustavo from the sensor lab to discuss our options.
