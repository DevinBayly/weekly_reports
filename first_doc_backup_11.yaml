    - - Should hear from the organizers about whether we are admitted this week
    - - Blake asked if he could join, so I spoke with organizers again
    - - Dima asked if he could join the team so I wrote to the organizers to update
        our roster and they allowed it
    - - Submitted an application to participate in the Argonne GPU hackathon which
        takes place at the end of april
      - Team mates are Sara Willis, Chris Reidy, and Abby Collier
      - Our project is to produce a gpu accelerated flocking simulation that we can

    - - Produced multithreading rust program that can do our "point to texture" conversion
      - from here I generated a brief example animation to demonstrate how we can
        use these textures with particle system visualizations
      - https://drive.google.com/file/d/13mIKrDNFu6SYvQSZCQxqFJnntc7HCl0y/view?usp=sharing
      - Aaron Bugaj notified us that the green fund is no longer a viable option for
        funding the media vis walls grant
      - Treating this year as a prototype of the program for working with students
        that have Biological System visualizations they want to do
    - - Started working on exploring unreal engine offerings related to our eventual
        visualization
      - Omani says the mist engine might be what we need for particle systems?
      - Created https://repl.it/@baylyd/quadtreeroot#script.js ,https://quadtreeroot.baylyd.repl.co/
      - Started working on Numpy method of calculating Luminosity of texture based
        on the distance that pixel lies from the nearest root point
      - Will use this texture for particle movement against or with value gradient
      - Ran into memory limit for certain sections of the root system on a Jetstream
        allocation
    - - Omani now has DCC status, which is great
      - Met and she got unreal engine installed on the machine that is more stable
        than the laptop
      - She's going to continue to brush up on her python
      - I'm going to try to create the first 3D texture of our first root so that
        we can use other programs than p5.js to do some of our first animated visualizations
    - - Succeeded at parsing the converted .vtu file into a mesh surrounding the points
        of the root simulation
      - Started a small example openprocessing sketch to explain the work to others,
        and myself at a later date
    - - Made more progress on understanding the .vtu file format and its layout of
        data, useful for visualizing the results of Open Root Sim
      - Began work with wireframe visualization of Zea Maize root development

      - Discussed using jetstream allocations instead of their AWS accounts to provide
        on demand access to media for their research projects from user's phones (didn't
        go into details about this)

      - Drafted process for systematically importing existing assets into Aframe
    - - Picked up an oculus rift from the library that I can use for 2 weeks
      - I'll try to record some of my previous unity build reviews so that I can refer
        to those as I start the Aframe conversion this way I don't have to rent the
        hardware multiple times
    - - Met with Jonathhan Crisman to get more details about the files that came with
        his folder of student work
      - Looks like i'll need to borrow an oculus in order to demo his scenes so that
        I can see what to create
      - Will reach out to Jen Nichols, and Jonathan  again to get help with this,
        Bryan Carter is where Jonathan got his temporary set so I might start there
        also
    - - Meeting with Jonathan Crisman to discuss beginning questions for converting
        his existing application to the Aframe WebVR platform so that future modification/maintenance
        is easier.

    - - Succeeded in using Vulkan via NoMachine remote desktop running on subdivided
        V100 Nvidia GPU
      - Created a screen cast video explaining the setup steps and sent to Jeremy
        Fischer in charge of NSF's Exosphere
      - He's very excited and is going to use the video to create documentation for
        users interested in my workflow when Exosphere is released to the public
    - - Worked on Jeremy Fischer's exosphere Nvidia JS Ubuntu 18 instance
      - Worried that their Nvidia V100 gridded VGPU isn't going to actually work for
        Vulkan which will limit the access to modern graphics development that researchers
        can do in their instances
      - Uncertain whether this is going to predict whether Vulkan will work with our
        V100s and K80s since they aren't currently being subdivided into virtual GPUs
      - Will be trying all of my steps on Exosphere outside of singularity containers
        this week to determine if singularity is the problem
    - - See whether I can use the singularity containers in the HPC testing environment
        that Chris has setup on Ocelote
      - If that works out, transfer the containers to the exosphere GPU instances
        I have from Jeremy Fischer and test there
    - - Successfully configured new desktop to work as build environment for the singularity
        containers that will have remote visualization/advanced graphics capability
      - Did test with nvidia/vulkan (openGL's successor) and was able to get graphical
        windows from the vkcube, and all of the rust gfx-hal demos
    - - Received new desktop machine with Nvidia card inside
      - Started trying to develop containers for use with HPC remote visualization
      - Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 is stuck with certain Nvidia Utils like nvidia-smi

      - Deadline for visuals of the first movement was Friday, but not everything
        was complete
      - Created a Trello to better track my progress and Kay's suggestions
