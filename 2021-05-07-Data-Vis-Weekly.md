# Data & Visualization Weekly Projects Report 2021_05_07

## Active Projects 


### Active Development 

* Advice For Thesis Defense Visualizations, Sabrina Nardin 
* Biosphere 2 Biosystems Visualization Collaboration 
	 * Met with Omani and talked more about how to use Touch Designer for compute shaders
	 * Corresponded with Ash about internship arrangement, haven't gotten all the details kinked out but a working document is here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a4dsJT1ZWRVSsP7CJB7bCF6RqsKClblq/view?usp=sharing
* Bryan Carter Photogrammetry 
	 * Met with Tayvien and tested out whether Metashape is going to be able to handle the number of images he has
	 * Sounds like there will probably be a need to use HPC just because the runtime is a bit too much for apporto?
	 * Should reach out to him and ask when his finals are over so that we can meet again and get situated on the HPC
* Data Visualization Roadshow With Jeff Oliver 
* Independent Study Abby Collier 
	 * Met and added final touches to her feature piece for the final part of the independent study
	 * Submitted grade with Blake, and will send Holly Brown a brief report with Abby's independent study webpage
* Jason Hortin Holographic Dance Graduate Project 
	 * Helped Jason connect with Bryan and Tech Core with idea that his holographic dance project could be part of the Tech Core summer internship
	 * Last I heard he had connected with Bryan to do some volumetric video capture in the Digital Humanities new center
* Migrant Forensic Empathy Project: A Digital Borderlands Grant Initiative 
	 * Lots of time going into this to try to wrap things up by the end of May
	 * Unfortunately I've hit a considerable obstacle that the mechanism I was counting on doesn't work for constraining the camera motion to the landscape mesh
	 * I've spent a significant amount of time trying to research alternatives and implementing my own solutions and I'm coming up empty
	 * I have posted to SO about this and hopefully that will get some attention
* Oyster Vibrio Literature Review 
* Remote Visualization Infrastructure Development 
	 * Met with Chris to discuss vulkan support
	 * He's still working on NoMachine configurations,
	 * Perhaps going to setup the vulkan 1.1 when the x server is live and see if I get different errors
* Resbaz Organizer And Workshop Provider 
* Stellarscape Astronomy Multimedia Dance Performance 
	 * Had monthly meeting last week
	 * Discussion about grants that will be pursued by other members on the team following our eventual performance
	 * Shared my updates about conversation with Gustavo on Sensors
	 * Demoed my most recent visualizations using Touch Designer
