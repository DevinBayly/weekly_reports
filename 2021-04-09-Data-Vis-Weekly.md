# Data & Visualization Weekly Projects Report 2021_04_09

## Active Projects 


### Active Development 

* Biosphere 2 Biosystems Visualization Collaboration 
* Data Visualization Roadshow With Jeff Oliver 
	 * Reaching out to the NSCS department to ask whether they have a graduate seminar which we can present to?
* Independent Study Abby Collier 
	 * Met with Abby several times this week
	 * The main focus of our time is on how to get her help with the touch designer visualizations for the show
	 * Kay has requested a recreation of this effect https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r9dd6csVZbk and I'm making it Abby's focus
	 * Discussed feedback loops, texture lookups, neighbor queries, and soon we will talk about writing custom materials with shader code
* Judging The Data Visualization Challenge 
* Migrant Forensic Empathy Project: A Digital Borderlands Grant Initiative 
	 * Big push on this project this week
	 * Wrote a Rust program which uses a quad tree structure to organize the 3d points of all our landscape vertices
	 * When we convert the Medical Examiner's office gps data to mesh coordinates we can then query the x,z position of a cross against the quad tree and get optimized calculations for the y coordinate where the cross should be placed.
	 * I then created a demo scene to show the mesh and the crosses placed in the landscape https://test-cross-placement.baylyd.repl.co/
	 * <10% of crosses placed above mesh in the air, so this next week I'll have to do some test cases with a smaller mesh, and known placement points.
* Oyster Vibrio Literature Review 
	 * Met with Emily and created a leaflet webmap with her lit review GPS data
	 * Will meet maximum 2 more times to help her get the website ready for her paper
* Remote Visualization Infrastructure Development 
* Resbaz Organizer And Workshop Provider 
	 * Met with Chinmay Joshi
	 * Discussed our todo items for getting the zoom links created
	 * Discussed scripts to provide the helpers and the workshop presenters so that things go smoother than the last time that Chinmay attended
	 * Discussed new approach to the recordings, and double checking on Accessibility strategies with Kelsey Gonzalez
* Stellarscape Astronomy Multimedia Dance Performance 
	 * Big meeting this week
	 * Also heard back from Brant Robertson and Evan Schneider that we can use their Galaxy outflow simulation visualization for our show
	 * This is such a cool looking effect, I don't know where it will fit in yet though
	 * Ran into some big performance problems with Touch Designer, but their most recent update appears to fix things
	 * Made demos for meeting with Hayley and Kay
	 * Will do more live outside testing with them next monday
	 * Still stuck on creating simple propagation effects
	 * Watched new series of videos by Stanslav Glasov, but he didn't go into the subject I was looking for on how to generate point/line network effects in touch designer on the GPU
