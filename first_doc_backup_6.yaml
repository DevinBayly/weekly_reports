    updates:
    - - Succeeded at parsing the converted .vtu file into a mesh surrounding the points
        of the root simulation
      - Started a small example openprocessing sketch to explain the work to others,
        and myself at a later date
    - - Made more progress on understanding the .vtu file format and its layout of
        data, useful for visualizing the results of Open Root Sim
      - Began work with wireframe visualization of Zea Maize root development

        on demand access to media for their research projects from user's phones (didn't
        go into details about this)

    updates:
    - - Met and addressed questions about the first week of using d3
      - Moved away from the template literal svg creation that is in vogue, and revisited
        the roots of d3 and DOM management with selections
      - Invited her to participate in the Argonne GPU hackathon as an extension of
        the datascience side of her independent study.
      - Worked on using the <g> element to organize our data in the graphics, and
        apply transforms to many elements at the same time.
      - Used the <g> elements to learn about how to create axes for our visualizations
    - - Met several times to try to troubleshoot the GLSL shader code on her feature
        p5.js sketch.
      - Shifted into our first week of the data visualization side of the independent
        study.

    - - Met with Jonathhan Crisman to get more details about the files that came with
        his folder of student work
      - Looks like i'll need to borrow an oculus in order to demo his scenes so that
        I can see what to create
      - Will reach out to Jen Nichols, and Jonathan  again to get help with this,
        Bryan Carter is where Jonathan got his temporary set so I might start there
        also
    - - Meeting with Jonathan Crisman to discuss beginning questions for converting
        his existing application to the Aframe WebVR platform so that future modification/maintenance
        is easier.
